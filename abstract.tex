\begin{abstract}
Data processing pipelines need to be executed at scales ranging from
small runs up through large production data release runs resulting in
millions of data products.  As part of the Rubin Observatory's pipeline
execution system, bps is the abstraction layer that provides an interface
to different Workflow Management Systems (WMS) such as HTCondor and PanDA.
During the submission process, the pipeline execution system interacts
with the Data Butler to produce science-oriented execution graphs from
algorithmic tasks.  bps converts this execution graph to a workflow graph
and then uses a WMS-specific plugin to submit and manage the workflow.
Here we will discuss the architectural design of this interface and
report briefly on the recent production of the Data Preview 0.2 release
and how the system is used by pipeline developers.
